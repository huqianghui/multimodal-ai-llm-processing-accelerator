    "# Document Intelligence Processor Walkthrough\n",
    "This notebook walks through the Document Intelligence processor component that is included in this repository. It is useful for converting the raw API response from Document Intelligence into something more useful, and which can be easily converted into the format required for sending to an LLM endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some features include:\n",
    "* Automatic extraction of rich content in a PDF, including tables, figures and more.\n",
    "* Output of text content in a PDF, images for each page and figure within the PDF, and pandas dataframes for tables within the PDF.\n",
    "* Automatic correction of image rotation when extracting page and figure images (if not corrected, this can completely destroy LLM extraction accuracy)\n",
    "* Custom definition of the content outputs, allowing for completely dynamic formatting of all content in a file.\n",
    "* Chunking of content into smaller parts (e.g. into chunks of X pages) which can then be processed as part of a Map Reduce pattern.\n",
    "* Automatic conversion of the content to the OpenAI message format, ready for processing with an LLM."

    "## Define Document Intelligence Processor configuration\n",
    "Now we will define the configuration for the processing of the result for Doc Intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document Intelligence returns many different element objects which correspond to different types of content in the document. Some examples are pages, sections, paragraphs, lines, words, figures, tables and more. Each of these elements have a corresponding processor which is designed to handle that type of element. These processors may simply format the output (e.g. for paragraphs and lines), but others may perform data processing to load and convert the raw API response into something more usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key things to look at:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Processed output dataclass type (Haystack `Document`s)\n",
    "Because the resulting information comes in different types (e.g. text, images, or dataframes), the processors use Haystack's Document dataclass as the standardised data structure for storing the content. These can then be post-processed into other formats such as OpenAI message dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Formatting text content\n",
    "When outputting text, the format of that text can be customized using the `*_text_formats` parameters of each element processor. The format can be defined such that different elements are returned in a specific format (such as italicing text or adding prefixes or suffixes). The format can feature placeholders for different parts of the content, with the list of possible placeholders shown in the constructor docstring for each processor class. \n",
    "* If the processor processes an element that does not contain any information for the placeholder, that format will be skipped. \n",
    "* For example, if the text formats for a figure processor was [\"*Figure Caption:* {caption}\", \"*Figure Footnotes:* {footnotes}\", \"*Figure Content:*\\n{content}\"] but the figure did not have any captions or footnotes, only the final text_format string would be returned in the result. \n",
    "* Final result: \"*Figure Content:\\n<text_extracted_from_inside_the_image>\"\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Outputting and rotating images\n",
    "The Page and Figure processors can automatically output page and figure images into the output, maintaining the correct order of the content. These processors can also automatically adjust the rotation of the image using the `angle` of the page as detected by Document Intelligence. This can ensure that all output images are rotated correctly prior to storing and using those images (this makes a big difference in how accurately LLM's can analyze those images).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Splitting output `Document`s into chunks\n",
    "When processing large documents, it can be useful to split the original document into separate chunks prior to processing. While the processors are not meant to completely replace other chunking tools (e.g. those in `Langchain` and other libraries), most chunkers are only designed to work with text content and will break if they are given multimodal data. To help avoid this, a `Splitter` can be used to split processed results. The default option is the `PageDocumentListSplitter`, which can split the list of full outputs into chunks based on the page number of the original content. This is useful in cases where you want to take a large Document (e.g. 50+ pages) and process those the document in chunks, then combine the chunk results into a final document-level result. This is a common pattern in document processing (known as the Map Reduce pattern).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Merging output `Document`s \n",
    "By default, each individual element within a document will result in 1 or more outputs. This means that a single page of paragraphs, lines or words would result in many different output `Document`s. Converting these to LLM messages would then result in hundreds of messages for each document. To prevent this, we can merge adjacent text elements together to reduce the number of text objects prior to converting them into LLM messages. This is accomplished with the \n",
    "* Example result:\n",
    "* Original documents: [text, text, image, text, text, text, table (markdown), text, image]\n",
    "* Merged documents: [text, image, text, image]"

      "Cancers of the head and neck may arise from any of the mucosal surfaces of the upper aerodigestive tract. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual, 8th Edition (8th Edition) introduces a num- ber of significant changes. These include a separate staging algorithm for human papilloma virus-associated cancer, restructuring of the head- and neck- specific cutaneous malignancy chapter, division of the pharynx staging system into three components, changes to the tumor (T) categories, addition of depth of invasion as a T characteristic in oral cancer, and the addition of extranodal tumor extension to the node (N) category.\n",
      "Maintaining a balance between hazard discrimination, hazard consistency, desirable spread in outcomes, predic- tion of cure, and the highest possible compliance was para- mount.1 As the world moves toward personalized medicine, demand will increase for individualized prediction of risk and outcomes, which may ultimately eclipse the traditional groupings of cancers used in staging. The complexity asso- ciated with defining individual risk, prognosis, and benefit from treatment is undeniable but it may eventually be miti- gated by relying on computerized algorithms presented in a user-friendly format on the handheld devices so ubiquitous in modern society.2 These may be applied through nomo- grams relying on key anatomic, biologic, and clinical fac- tors. Nonetheless, a feasible pretreatment approach (i.e., clinical TNM) applicable in all medical settings and to all patients should be maintained both for defining treatment and for evaluating the effect of treatment across popula- tions and time. Thus, the 8th Edition represents a compro- mise between a very accurate, but very complex system (where compliance would be low) and a very simple system, which would permit high compliance at the expense of reduced predictive capacity.\n",
      "Cancer staging is used worldwide in countries with widely varying levels of resources. Assuring harmony between the AJCC and Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging systems was an important goal and it could not have been accomplished without the wisdom, collegiality, and sense of purpose displayed by members of the UICC Head and Neck Committee. We are especially indebted to the tre- mendous work ethic and attention to detail exhibited by members of the AJCC Head and Neck Expert Panel and its many subcommittees and disease site leaders. Both groups have balanced the need for a worldwide system with the need for incremental improvement.\n",

      "\n",
      "The major changes in the 8th Edition for head and neck can- cer reflect the changing environment of head and neck oncol- ogy. The areas highlighted in this section include general changes and additions to cancer staging that apply across most Head and Neck sites. The specific changes for each site are detailed in the respective chapters.\n",

      "A major addition is a restructured head- and neck-specific cutaneous malignancy chapter. This acknowledges the increasing need for head and neck oncologists to stage cuta- neous malignancies.\n",

      "· HPV-negative oropharynx and hypopharynx remain together in view of their shared biology and typical risk factors.\n",
      "· A new chapter describing the staging of human papil- loma virus-associated (HPV) oropharyngeal cancers (OPC) has been added.\n",
      "The rapidly increasing incidence of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) associated cancers of the tonsil and tongue base has posed numerous challenges in diagnosis, management strategies, and outcomes reporting.3 The AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 7th Edition (7th Edition) TNM staging of OPC tumors lacks hazard discrimination, hazard consis- tency, and capacity to predict outcome. HR-HPV associated cancers occur more often in younger, healthier individuals with little or no tobacco exposure. HPV16/18 are the most commonly detected transcriptionally active HR-HPV types. The established staging criteria defined in the 7th Edition are insufficient to adequately stage and define the biology of this emerging disease. Immunohistochemistry for p16 overex- pression has emerged as a robust surrogate biomarker for HPV-mediated carcinogenesis and as an independent posi- tive prognosticator in this specific context.4 Direct detection of HPV is not used as a defining factor due to limited avail- ability of the test, cost, and lack of additional ability to pre- dict survival compared with p16 overexpression. p16 overexpression was chosen as the best identifier of disease because of its low cost, universal applicability, and ease of reading compared with other HPV identifiers. It is important to remind clinicians, however, that p16 overexpression is context-specific and currently applicable only to the tonsillar and base of tongue regions of the oropharynx. Designation of p16 overexpression should occur only when there is signifi- cant staining following established criteria.4 To increase the utility of staging and acknowledge the emergence of a dis- tinct disease, the p16+ and p16- OPCs are now separately described. OPC with p16 expression of weak intensity or limited distribution (<75% of cells) should be staged using oropharyngeal carcinoma p16- guidelines.\n",
      "The 8th Edition TNM staging system for HPV-related can- cers of the oropharynx provides better discrimination between stages. T categories remain the same for both p16+ and p16-, except that the p16+ classification includes no Tis category and no T4b, and p16- oropharynx, like other non-HPV associ- ated cancers in the head and neck, includes no TO category.\n",
      "The p16+ clinical TNM classification is applicable to all cases before treatment (both surgically and non-surgically treated cases). The pathological classification is confined to cases managed with surgery (following examination of the resected specimens, as with all other pathologically staged tumors).\n",
      "A unique and potentially perplexing feature of pathologi- cal staging in HPV+ is that in the data set, pN3 category\n",
      "behaves as Stage I while pN2 behaves as Stage II. This find- ing is unprecedented, and only prospective collection of data will help clarify this apparent paradox.5\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## **Rules for Classification**\n",
      "\n",
      "Because a fundamental difference in outcome was observed for cases based on the number of nodes confirmed pathologi- cally and the clinical presence of contralateral nodes and nodes larger than 6cm, two systems were developed for these two clinical scenarios. Pathological TNM (pTNM) applies only if the patient undergoes surgery and uses the pathological characteristics of the primary tumor and the number of positive nodes obtained from pathological exami- nation of the surgically resected tissue. Clinical TNM (cTNM) utilizes information from available history, physical examination, and whatever imaging is performed. It is clear that to accurately enumerate clinically involved lymph nodes is not possible for a worldwide pretreatment clinical stage classification; that parameter, therefore, is confined to pTNM. It is recommended that clinical staging data be col- lected on ALL patients for the purposes of pretreatment assessment, providing a uniform standard for comparing cases across treatment centers around the world and for treat- ment planning, including selection of postsurgical treatment and prediction of prognosis.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## **Definition of Primary Tumor (T): Changes**\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout the head and neck chapters, the Primary Tumor (T) categories (for size and extent of the primary tumor) are generally similar, with changes in the skin, nasopharynx, and oral cavity chapters. A key change from prior editions of the TNM system is the elimination of the TO category in sites other than nasopharynx and HPV+ oropharynx. Specific changes include the following:\n",
      "· T categorization for skin cancer recognizes the critical importance of depth of invasion beyond 6 mm and peri- neural invasion, both of which upstage a lesion to T3.\n",
      "· In nasopharynx, the previous T4 criteria “masticator space\" and \"infratemporal fossa\" are replaced by a specific description of soft tissue involvement to avoid ambiguity. Adjacent muscle involvement (including medial pterygoid, lateral pterygoid, and prevertebral muscles) is designated as T2.\n",
      "· The biggest change in T category is for the oral cavity. Depth of invasion (DOI) has been added as a modifica- tion to T to enhance the distinction between the super- ficial or exophytic tumors and those that are more invasive. Clinicians have long recognized the very dif-\n",
      "ferent biological behaviors between these types of lesions, and this is now acknowledged by increasing the T category for every 5-mm increase in DOI in three categories: less than or equal to 5 mm; greater than 5 mm, but not greater than 10mm; and greater than 10mm). It is important to recognize the distinction between tumor thickness and true DOI. It has been recognized since the early work of Spiro and co-work- ers, in the mid-1980s, that prognosis of oral cancers worsens as the tumor grows thicker, as with skin malignancies.6 The somewhat more sophisticated measure of DOI has been recorded for oral cavity can- cers since the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 6th Edition (6th Edition). Clinicians experienced with head and neck cancer generally will have few prob- lems identifying a superficial and less invasive lesion (≤5mm) from those of moderate depth (>5 mm and ≤10mm) or deeply invasive cancers (>10mm) through clinical examination alone. Such experts have estimated the maximum dimensions for complicated lesions of the tonsil or palate for many years. In apply- ing the DOI modifier, if there are doubts or ambiguity, the clinician should apply the general TNM uncer- tainty staging rule of using the lower attribute for a category (in this case a lower DOI categorization).\n",
      "· Extrinsic muscle infiltration is no longer a staging criterion for T4 designation in oral cavity, because depth of invasion supersedes it and extrinsic muscle invasion is difficult to assess (both clinically and pathologically).\n",
      "· An additional change is the elimination of the TO cate- gory for all oral cavity, skin, larynx, HPV- oropharynx, hypopharynx, and sinus. This change affects cases where a cervical lymph node has metastatic squamous cell car- cinoma, but no primary tumor is identified despite thor- ough history, examination, and available imaging studies. Assigning these cases to a specific head and neck site is not possible. Previous editions of TNM stag- ing included a TO category in each of these disease sites. However, it is seldom used and, if it is, the cancer could not be assigned to a stage group. Therefore, for the 8th Edition, the Expert Panel eliminated the TO category from the head and neck staging systems. A separate stag- ing system for those cases with an involved cervical node without a known primary tumor has been added to the chapter entitled Cervical Node and Unknown Primary of the Head and Neck. These cases should be classified under the TNM rules for a cancer of unknown primary outlined in that chapter.\n",
      "· The exceptions where TO continues to be used as a T-category are HPV-associated cancer and Epstein- Barr Virus (EBV) associated cancers. For HPV- associated cancers identified in a cervical lymph\n",
      "node (defined as p16 positive), the case is staged using the p16 positive oropharynx system, which continues to include a \"TO\" category. EBV-positive cancers identified in a cervical node with no obvious primary are staged using the EBV-related nasophar- ynx system, in which the \"TO\" category is main- tained. TO is allowed for salivary gland cancers identified by their unique histology.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "# **Regional Lymph Node (N) Category: Introduction of Extranodal Extension**\n",
      "\n",
      "The 8th Edition introduces the use of extranodal extension (ENE) in categorizing the \"N\" category for metastatic cancer to neck nodes. The effect of ENE on prognosis in head and neck cancers is profound, except for those tumors associated with HR-HPV.7 Including this important prognostic feature was considered critical for improving staging.\n",
      "Most of the evidence supporting ENE as an adverse prog- nostic factor is based on histopathological characterization of ENE, especially the distinction between microscopic and macroscopic (or gross) ENE. For clinical staging only, the presence of unquestionable ENE as determined by physical examination and supported by radiological evidence is to be used. As per the standard rules of cancer staging, if there is uncertainty or ambiguity for categorization of T, N, or M, the lower category is assigned.\n",
      "Stringent criteria for clinical examination must be met to assign a diagnosis of ENE. Current imaging modalities have significant limitations in their ability to accurately identify ENE.8 This mandates that radiological evidence alone is insufficient. Unambiguous evidence of gross ENE on clini- cal examination (e.g., invasion of skin, infiltration of muscu- lature or dense tethering to adjacent structures, or cranial nerve, brachial plexus, sympathetic trunk, or phrenic nerve invasion with dysfunction) supported by strong radiographic evidence is required to permit clinical classification of dis- ease as ENE(+).\n",
      "Pathological ENE also must be clearly defined as exten- sion of metastatic tumor (tumor present within the confines of the lymph node and extending through the lymph node capsule into the surrounding connective tissue, with or with- out associated stromal reaction). Again, when there is doubt or ambiguity in the reporting, the lesser or lower category is assigned, in this case ENE(-).\n",

      "niques-computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasonography-may be employed, but clinical examina- tion is sufficient to assign clinical stage. In advanced tumor stages, imaging studies add to the accuracy of primary tumor (T) and nodal (N) categorization, especially in the nasopharyngeal and paranasal sinuses primary sites, as well as for regional lymph nodes. Endoscopic evaluation of the primary tumor and examination under anesthesia when appropriate may be needed for accurate T categorization. These may be supplemented by needle biopsy (most often fine-needle aspiration biopsy [FNAB]) to confirm the pres- ence of tumor and its histopathologic nature, while recog- nizing that a negative needle biopsy cannot rule out the presence of tumor. When imaging studies are not done or not available, as in low-resource regions, clinical stage may be based solely on careful history, physical examination, and/or endoscopy.\n",
      "Clinical stage should be reported for all cases, as well as pathological stage when surgery is performed. Any diag- nostic information that contributes to the overall accuracy of the pretreatment assessment should be considered in clinical staging and treatment planning. When surgical treatment is carried out, cancer of the head and neck can be staged pathologically (pTNM) using all information avail- able from clinical assessment, as well as from the surgeon's operative findings and pathological study of the resected specimen.\n",
      "With the exception of p16+ OPC (a recently recognized disease entity), no major changes in the stage groupings are recommended. The current stage groupings reflect recent practices, clinical relevance, and contemporary data. T4 tumors continue to be subdivided into moderately advanced (T4a) and very advanced (T4b) categories. Stage IV disease is divided into moderately advanced, local/regional disease (Stage IVA), very advanced local/regional disease (Stage IVB), and distant metastatic disease (Stage IVC).\n",
      "The following chapters present the staging classification for nine major head and neck sites and disease entities:\n",

      "# **COLLECTION OF KEY PATIENT AND TUMOR FACTORS**\n",
      "\n",
      "An ongoing effort to evaluate the effect on prognosis of both tumor and non-tumor-related factors is underway. Cancer reg- istrars should continue to perform chart abstraction to collect information regarding specific factors related to prognosis as outlined in each chapter. These data will be used to enhance the predictive power of the staging system in future revisions. Key domains of information to collect include the following:\n",
      "· Comorbidity: In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined previously, the overall health or presence of comorbid conditions of patients influences outcome. Comorbidity can be assessed and semi-quantified using validated standardized tools applied by review of medical records.9 Accurate reporting of all major illnesses in the patient's medical record is essential. General performance measures are helpful in predicting survival.\n",
      "· Performance Status: In addition, the AJCC strongly recommends that the clinician report performance sta- tus using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky performance mea- sures, along with standard staging information.\n",
      "· Lifestyle factors: Tobacco and alcohol abuse adversely influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking (in pack-years) and alcohol consumption (in number of days drinking per week and number of drinks per day) will provide important data for future analysis. However, exactly how these should be incorporated in staging remains undefined. Smoking is known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis, but valid data are insufficient to allow it to be readily introduced into the staging systems. Smoking history should be collected as an important element of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard should classify smoking history as follows: never, ≤ 10 pack-years, > 10 but ≤20 pack-years, > 20 pack-years.\n",
      "· Nutrition: Nutrition also is important to prognosis and can be indirectly measured by weight loss of> 10% of body weight over 3 months.10\n",
      "· Depression: Depression adversely impacts quality of life and survival.11, 12 A previous or current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the medical record.\n",
