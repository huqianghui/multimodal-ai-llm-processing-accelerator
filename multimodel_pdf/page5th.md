nodes in the head and neck are subdivided into specific ana- tomic subsites and grouped into seven levels for ease of description (Fig. 5.1, Tables 5.1 and 5.2).

In addition to the standard groups listed in Tables 5.1 and 5.2, other lymph node groups are defined by their specific anatomic location. Numbers of nodes are counted toward N category, but they are listed separately using the following descriptors.

· Suboccipital

· Retropharyngeal

· Parapharyngeal

· Buccinator (facial)

· Preauricular

· Periparotid and intraparotid


## **Other General Rules for Assessing Regional Lymph Nodes**

Histopathologic examination is necessary to exclude the presence of tumor in lymph nodes for pathological categorization (pNO). No imaging study (as yet) can iden- tify microscopic tumor foci in regional nodes or distin- guish between small reactive nodes and small malignant nodes.
