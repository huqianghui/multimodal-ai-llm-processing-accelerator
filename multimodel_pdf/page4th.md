niques-computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), and ultrasonography-may be employed, but clinical examina- tion is sufficient to assign clinical stage. In advanced tumor stages, imaging studies add to the accuracy of primary tumor (T) and nodal (N) categorization, especially in the nasopharyngeal and paranasal sinuses primary sites, as well as for regional lymph nodes. Endoscopic evaluation of the primary tumor and examination under anesthesia when appropriate may be needed for accurate T categorization. These may be supplemented by needle biopsy (most often fine-needle aspiration biopsy [FNAB]) to confirm the pres- ence of tumor and its histopathologic nature, while recog- nizing that a negative needle biopsy cannot rule out the presence of tumor. When imaging studies are not done or not available, as in low-resource regions, clinical stage may be based solely on careful history, physical examination, and/or endoscopy.

Clinical stage should be reported for all cases, as well as pathological stage when surgery is performed. Any diag- nostic information that contributes to the overall accuracy of the pretreatment assessment should be considered in clinical staging and treatment planning. When surgical treatment is carried out, cancer of the head and neck can be staged pathologically (pTNM) using all information avail- able from clinical assessment, as well as from the surgeon's operative findings and pathological study of the resected specimen.

With the exception of p16+ OPC (a recently recognized disease entity), no major changes in the stage groupings are recommended. The current stage groupings reflect recent practices, clinical relevance, and contemporary data. T4 tumors continue to be subdivided into moderately advanced (T4a) and very advanced (T4b) categories. Stage IV disease is divided into moderately advanced, local/regional disease (Stage IVA), very advanced local/regional disease (Stage IVB), and distant metastatic disease (Stage IVC).

The following chapters present the staging classification for nine major head and neck sites and disease entities:

· Oral Cavity

· Major Salivary Glands

· Nasopharynx

· HPV-Mediated (p16+) Oropharyngeal Cancer

· Oropharynx (p16-) and Hypopharynx

· Nasal Cavity and Paranasal Sinuses

· Larynx

· Mucosal Melanoma of the Head and Neck

· Cutaneous Carcinoma of the Head and Neck

· An additional chapter explaining Cervical Lymph Nodes and Unknown Primary Tumors of the Head and Neck is included for additional clarity and staging information.


# **COLLECTION OF KEY PATIENT AND TUMOR FACTORS**

An ongoing effort to evaluate the effect on prognosis of both tumor and non-tumor-related factors is underway. Cancer reg- istrars should continue to perform chart abstraction to collect information regarding specific factors related to prognosis as outlined in each chapter. These data will be used to enhance the predictive power of the staging system in future revisions. Key domains of information to collect include the following:

· Comorbidity: In addition to the importance of the TNM factors outlined previously, the overall health or presence of comorbid conditions of patients influences outcome. Comorbidity can be assessed and semi-quantified using validated standardized tools applied by review of medical records.9 Accurate reporting of all major illnesses in the patient's medical record is essential. General performance measures are helpful in predicting survival.

· Performance Status: In addition, the AJCC strongly recommends that the clinician report performance sta- tus using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), Zubrod, or Karnofsky performance mea- sures, along with standard staging information.

· Lifestyle factors: Tobacco and alcohol abuse adversely influence survival. Accurate recording of smoking (in pack-years) and alcohol consumption (in number of days drinking per week and number of drinks per day) will provide important data for future analysis. However, exactly how these should be incorporated in staging remains undefined. Smoking is known to have a deleterious effect on prognosis, but valid data are insufficient to allow it to be readily introduced into the staging systems. Smoking history should be collected as an important element of the demographics and may be included in Prognostic Groups in the future. For practicality, the minimum standard should classify smoking history as follows: never, ≤ 10 pack-years, > 10 but ≤20 pack-years, > 20 pack-years.

· Nutrition: Nutrition also is important to prognosis and can be indirectly measured by weight loss of> 10% of body weight over 3 months.10

· Depression: Depression adversely impacts quality of life and survival.11, 12 A previous or current diagnosis of depression should be recorded in the medical record.


# **REGIONAL LYMPH NODES**

The status of the regional lymph nodes in head and neck can- cer is of such prognostic importance that the cervical nodes must be assessed for each patient and tumor. The lymph
